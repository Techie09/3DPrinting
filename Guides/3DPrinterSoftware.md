 [**`🗺 3D Printer Software Guide`**](#3d-printer-software-guide)**`> Overview`**

## **Overview**

This is a guide to a variety of software (online, offline, free and paid) that is used for anything from creating models to printing them remotely in real-tine,

I have broken it down into three categories:

- Online - Software available without download. Some require accounts.

- Software - Downloadable software. includes modelling, slicing and meshing. 

- References - Sites that I have found helpful with guides, lists and articles on all things 3D.

### **3D Modeling**

3D Modeling is an important first step when creating something to 3D Print. However some of the software has its pros and cons, so I would recommend trying all the options listed, and to learn about their strengths and weaknesses to better know what tool is right for a specific project.

---

SketchUp [`🔗sketchup.com`](https://www.sketchup.com/plans-and-pricing/sketchup-free)

>SketchUp was originally developed by Google and was apart of their online suite of tools and provided CAD functionality. It is functional in some areas where other CAD software are not (examples: measure tool or extrude 2D profiles along a constrained contour). It has recently be bought by Trimble, a Large Construction firm, but Google still has some (now confusing) references to SketchUp. In all, this is a fairly solid CAD solution.

---

TinkerCAD [`🔗tinkercad.com`](https://www.tinkercad.com/)

>TinkerCad is a fairly easy and straight-forward CAD software. Its been around for a while and has lots of support and documentation. I noticed that it does struggle to do some tasks such as slicing a model in half, but overall is a good CAD solution to familiarize yourself with.

[**`🗺 3D Printer Software Guide`**](#3d-printer-software-guide)**`>`**[**`Online Software`**](#online-software)**`> Slicing Software`**

### **Slicing Software**

I believe there are a few other options out there, but since slicing client-side in the web is not very performant, It would be mostly used on-the-go or lightweight work.

---

Kiri-Moto [`🔗grid.space/kiri`](https://grid.space/kiri/)
>The clean Interface and extensive controls provides a powerful way to view your project in the 3D and make additional changes.

---

OpenSlicer [`🔗openslicer.github.io`](https://openslicer.github.io/OpenSlicer/dist/index.html)

>Another Clean Interface with prehaps less functionality than the prior option, but nonetheless another possible solution for lightweight use.

[**`🗺 3D Printer Software Guide`**](#3d-printer-software-guide)**`>`**[**`Online Software`**](#online-software)**`> Miscellaneous`**

### **Miscellaneous**

Below is a collection of tools with a variety of purposes, usually very lightweight and specific to one need.

---

G-Code Viewer [`🔗gcode.ws`](https://gcode.ws/)

> This allows you upload a gcode file and view slicing and follow toolpathing over a timeline, or by layer. It also supports an embedded iframe with the ability to set a local or online file to the viewer if you wish.

---

STL Viewer [`🔗viewstl.com`](https://www.viewstl.com/)

> This STL Viewer makes it easy to view 3D models in browser! Great if you want to view an STL on-the-go, or view an STL before downloading it to make sure it is what you wanted.

---

Text2STL [`🔗text2stl.mestres.fr`](https://text2stl.mestres.fr/en-us/generator)

>This is a simple tool to take some Text and turn it into a 3D Model. It works, but the interface can be a bit annoying. Some fonts don't seem to work, and trying different font is a hassle since the list doesn't remember your selection, and using scroll or arrow keys does not swtich the selected font.

---

Visual Studio Code [`🔗vscode.dev`](https://vscode.dev/)

>Paired with Github, the recent launch of Visual Studio Online and the access to Extensions (even if a bit limited) gives plenty of options for viewing and editing gcode. Great for checking code from a repository, or for validating custom gcode using a linting service. These is also workspaces, repository control, snippets, event scripting, and intellisense (responsive tooltips) that provide additional functionality that is hard to find in other gcode editors. Don't forget that its vscode, so you can also do crazy stuff like liveshare and collaborate with others in real-time to write (or debug) your gcode. Oh, and its free!

[**`🗺 3D Printer Software Guide`**](#3d-printer-software-guide)**`>`**[**`Online Software`**](#online-software)**`> Galleries`**

### **Galleries**

Here are some sites that are useful for finding 3D Models. This is far from a complete list, but is instead common sites I use.

---

Thingiverse [`🔗thingiverse.com`](https://www.thingiverse.com/)

>Likely the most popular (and most disliked) source for 3D Models. A Service provided by Makerbot, Thingiverse supports creating collections, Remixing, uploading Makes, and creating your own content. This is a great place to go for 3D Models... if it works. Some users have had issues downloading or accessing files or pages. It seems it is usually caused by Ad Blocking, but there are sometimes more technical problems such as DNS, VPN, or ISP that may be affecting the reliability.

Cults3D [`🔗cults3d.com`](https://cults3d.com/)

>A Free & Paid 3D Model site that has many of the same features as Thingiverse. Some models found here are very elaborate and the creators post their creations here to generate some money for their work. I usually try this one site first before using Thingiverse, although I have amassed rather large amount of collections and things on Thingiverse.

---

Yeggi [`🔗yeggi.com`](https://www.yeggi.com/)

>Yeggi is currently the largest search enging for 3D models. It includes sites such as Thingiverse and Cults3D as well. I will sometimes use this as a way to search if I cannot find what I'm looking for or if I find Yeggi listed in a google Search.

[**`🗺 3D Printer Software Guide`**](#3d-printer-software-guide)**`>`**[**`Software`**](#software)**`> 3D Modeling & CAD`**

### **3D Modeling & CAD**

Here are some options I've used to 3D Model and export to STL or have been recommended.

---

Anim8or [`🔗anim8or.com`](https://www.anim8or.com/)

>Rarely found listed as an editor for 3D Models, but a great tool that is free. I used this years ago when I thought about becoming a Game Developer and thought I needed to be good at code and graphic design. I took the time to follow a couple of the tutorials and found them very helpful in learning the tool. Lately I have been trying various CAD and slicer tools to accomplish my projects, but I'm finding myself wanting to use Anim8or instead. It strikes a balance between technical drawing, and graphic design. This is definitely worth checking out.

---

Sketchup Make 2017 [`🔗help.sketchup.com`](https://help.sketchup.com/en/downloading-older-versions)

> SketchUp used to be a Desktop Application that was free to use, but was moved to the Cloud and eventually google sold Sketchup to Trimble. If looking for the desktop application, fear not! Sketchup Make 2017 is still downloadable and free, although it is no longer supported.

---

OpenSCAD [`🔗OpenSCAD`](https://openscad.org/)

>I have been recommended this a few times. While I don't think I would use this as a primary tool for developing 3D Models, I think it has some very important use-cases. OpenSCAD is a tool that uses a programming language to procedurally generate 3D Models. While most tools provide a What-You-See-Is-What-You-Get (WYSIWYG) approach that limits the user to only the functionality supported, OpenSCAD provides the user with ability to create dynamic 3D models just by setting some values for the scripted code to use.
>
>- Can procedurally generate Text into 3D Models.
>- Can produce dynamic 3D Models parametrically.

[**`🗺 3D Printer Software Guide`**](#3d-printer-software-guide)**`>`**[**`Software`**](#software)**`> Slicing`**

### **Slicing**

Slicers are by the dozen at this point. Every major brand seems to have a slicer. Each tend to have some unique features and some are more ambitious than others.

---

CrealitySlicer [`🔗creality.com`](https://www.creality.com/download/)

>I have not heard anyone mention or recommend this one, but since I have a Creality 3D Printer, I thought it was worth throwing on the list.

---

Cura [`🔗ultimaker.com`](https://ultimaker.com/software/ultimaker-cura)

>This is one of the top most used Slicers in the community. It has been long-standing, open-sourced, and has lots of features.

---

PrusaSlicer [`🔗github.com/prusa3d`](https://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer/releases)

>Another very popular slicer, this one is based on Cura, but has its own interface and unique features that make it a great option to use.

[**`🗺 3D Printer Software Guide`**](#3d-printer-software-guide)**`>`**[**`Software`**](#software)**`> Multi-purpose`**

### **Multi-purpose**

Here is some software that don't perform just one task, but may be more comprehensive and attempt to replace multiple tools previsouly listed.

---

MakerBot Print [`🔗makerbot.com`](https://www.makerbot.com/3d-printers/apps/makerbot-print/download/)

>I have used or heard recommendations for this slicer, but it apparently provides slicing and remote printing capabilities. It may be an option to check out if you want your slicer to also talk to your printer.

---

MatterControl [`🔗matterhackers.com`](https://www.matterhackers.com/store/l/mattercontrol/sk/MKZGTDW6)

>A Unique, brand-focused software, but stands out for its ambitious attempt to support 3D Modeling, Slicing, and remote Printing (with cloud support) all in one solution. Its printing abilities is extendable, but much more limited than OctoPrint and as of now, does not provide support to talk to OctoPrint.

---

Visual Studio Code [`🔗code.VisualStudio.com`](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download)

> VS Code is a great utility to support a larger application with dedicated features. VS Code has Gcode support for syntaax highlighting, snippets, linting validation, and repository control. It also has extensions for STL viewing, so why not make use of VS Code as a lightweight viewer and editor for local (and performance intensive) work.

[**`🗺 3D Printer Software Guide`**](#3d-printer-software-guide)**`>`**[**`Software`**](#software)**`> Miscellaneous Tools`**

### **Miscellaneous Tools**

Here are some additional tools for remote 3D Printer control, photogrammetry, mesh manipulation and optimization.

---

ColMap [`🔗colmap.github.io`](https://colmap.github.io/index.html)

>A Product of Research at a University, this software has a GUI, but can run in command-line and is used to analyze a set of images and produce a 3D Model using a technique called photogrammetry. It has lots of advanced tuning abilities if you'd like, but works well without tuning. Unfortunately it does take some time to run. Would make a great Ron Co product: "Just set it and forget it!"

---

MeshLab [`🔗meshlab.net`](https://www.meshlab.net/)

>A good next step if using ColMap. ColMap infers a lot of detail and can create some messy models. MeshLab will automatically optimize the 3D Model is a more complete and improved model.

---

MeshMixer [`🔗meshmixer.com`](https://www.meshmixer.com/)

>This one allows for some nice Mesh Manipulating and may be exactly what you need when modifying an existing model.

---

PrintRun [`🔗pronterface.com`](https://www.pronterface.com/)

>Popular software to provide direct control over your printer remotely. Useful primarily for calibration and testing, but has other purposes.

I added this one since I reference it so much. It contains some various suggested mods and upgrades. the youtube video linked continues the adventure with even more suggestions and reviews previously installed mod & updgrades with updates on improvements and failures. A great place to get started with an Ender 3-Pro.

### **Bonus: Why z-axis mods might be bad** [`🔗BFTB design: Z axis wobble, lead screws and bearing blocks on Youtube`](https://youtu.be/2Z7mZVvPlc8)

I found this indirectly from the article on Creality on Ender 3/Pro Upgrades & Mods. The youtuber has a series of videos and in part 2 he references BFTB design's video about z-axis wobble. It is very interesting to learn about and important to know mechanically how mods can impact accuracy and performance.
